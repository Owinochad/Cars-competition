# Car Competition

## Overview
Welcome to the Car Competition project! This document outlines the rules of engagement to avoid conflicts and ensure smooth collaboration among contributors.

## Rules of Engagement

### 1. Picking a Feature
- Before starting to work on a feature, check the `README.md` to see if the feature is already being worked on.
- If the feature is not listed, add an entry in the "In-Progress Features" section below with your GitHub username and the date.

### 2. Creating a Branch
- Each feature should have its own branch.
- Use the following naming convention for branches: `feature/your-feature-name`
- Example: `feature/add-user-authentication`

### 3. Working on the Feature
- Commit your changes to your feature branch regularly.
- Follow the commit message guidelines:
  - Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
  - Keep messages concise yet descriptive

### 4. Testing
- Thoroughly test your feature in the feature branch.
- Ensure there are no conflicts or issues before considering a merge.

### 5. Merging with Main
- Once the feature is fully tested, create a pull request (PR) to merge your feature branch into the `main` branch.
- Request at least one review from other contributors.
- After approval, merge the PR into `main`.

### 6. Updating the Readme
- Once the feature is merged, update the "In-Progress Features" section to reflect that the feature is completed.
